# Test Assignment: Display a List of Users
The goal of this test assignment is to display a list of users on a web page. The list of users could be visualized as either a list of tiles or a list of rows. User can switch between two visualization modes. Data for a list of users is taken from a JavaScript object.

## Solution: Vanilla JavaScript
This project solves the assignment using Vanilla JavaScript. For the sake of simplicity, all JavaScript code is located in one `script.js` file. Similarly, HTML code is located in `index.html` file and CSS code is located in `styles.css`.

This solution uses [Document.createDocumentFragment()](https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/API/Document/createDocumentFragment) to dynamically update the HTML page in a performant way.
